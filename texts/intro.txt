It was a typical day in Dollworld, at the 
Cupcake Kingdom.
The Jester was entertaining the children as they 
consume all the delicious treats provided for them.
Suddenly, loud noises could be heard nearby 
the kingdom, which frightened the kids.
They could not enjoy the festivities as they 
cower in fear for their safety.
"Fear not children! As Queen, I can assure you that 
no harm will graze upon us. I'll have the noble knight, 
Sir Torres Ganache, to eradicate whatever threat 
to this kingdom!", said Krie Klubnika.
And so, Torres is sent out to the source of the 
alarming noises, The Cotton Candy woods.
As the honourable knight of the Cupcake Kingdom,
she will stop at nothing to ensure the welfare 
of this domain.
