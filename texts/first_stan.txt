Heyyy Torres~! Are you prepared for the battle ahead?

Of course I am. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

Such a wet blanket! Our fates are up to you
y'know, you should be proud!
Just a reminder, you use the [WASD] keys to
move around later. 
Press [J] to attack and [K] to defend. And when
you're feeling "energized", use [Q]!
...?

Why are you telling me this?

You'll understand it later~

Good luck and talk with me if you need
anything!
