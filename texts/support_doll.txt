Stanley O'Cake, The Court Jester
When I am active in battle, I will give an attack buff 
to you, Torres, for every 3 seconds. I will also reduce
the enemy's "excitement" during that time.

If you initiate my ultimate attack, I will reset all
enemies moxie to 0 and the repercussion would cause
damage to all enemies on the screen by 50.

Krie Klubnika, The Queen
The Queen oversees all subjects and is responsible
for their well-being. Krie heals the player 2% of 
their healthpoints for every 3 seconds.

Initiate Her Majesty's ultimate and she will heal 
you significantly.

Louie, The Pierrot Prince
Louie's floats are cold and cool. There are frost 
around the environment when he is active, which slows 
down the enemies every 3 seconds. 

His ultimate initiation summons a blizzard which will 
freeze the enemies' movements for 5 seconds.
